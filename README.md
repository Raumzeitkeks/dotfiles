## Disclaimer

I don't consider myself an expert in system administration or security, so neither should you.
I have tried to give this the due attention for a private desktop/laptop system and use this setup every day,
but it may still contain fatal security faults and annoying bugs.


## Usage and contribution

I am happy if you consider using or improving (parts of) these guides and configurations. Feel free to do so any time.
It would be very kind if you gave feedback in the form of Github stars, issues or pull requests.
If you publish something based on this work it would be nice if you linked back here, but you are not obliged to.
